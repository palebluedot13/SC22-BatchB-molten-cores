    "Our target variable (the variable we are trying to predict) is `diagnosis`. Our only problem is that the diagnosis variable will either be an 'M' or a 'B', which is not something our model will understand. We need to change our M's to 1's and B's to 0's so that our model can think like computers do -- using numbers!  \n",
